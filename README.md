## Opening doors for Computer Science students one project at a time. 
This website shows users Computer Science students opportunities around them.

### How We Built It
SciSearch was built using HTML, JavaScript, ArcGIS, and Firebox. HTML and JavaScript were for the front-end and back-end development respectively, ArcGIS was used for the map features, and Firebox was used to launch our app. 

### Challenges
There were a lot of challenges for us. First was finding a database to use, however we realized we were making our product because there were no databases or even websites like ours. This meant, we had to make one which none of us had ever had to do. Another challenge we had was figuring out which APIs to use and how to use them. We knew since we were doing a location based project, ArcGIS was a no brainer. We selected it for it’s built in map features. We also decided to use Firebase to launch our website. These were challenges for us because none of us had ever used these APIs and had to learn them from scratch. 

### Inspiration
Growing up in a small town, my school didn’t start computer science until I was a senior in high school. This meant we didn’t have access to the tech opportunities and projects like other people since we were just starting and being an Asian female, it’s not like people were sending tech opportunities my way. Projects and experience are vital to Computer Science education. We created this product because we would have loved something like this in high school. We hope this website can increase interest and make Computer Science a little less daunting.

## What's Next for SciSearch
SciSearch has lots of room to grow. In the future, we hope to use more API's to increase the amount of opportunities provided on SciSearch. Hopefully one day, we can also accept opportunities from users as well.
